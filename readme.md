# OwO, What's This?
Mjolnir Forge Editor is a tool *(based off [Halo Reach Forge Assistant](https://github.com/Lookenpeepers/Halo-Reach-Forge-Assistant))*, for the popular free 3D software [Blender](https://www.blender.org/), which modifies Halo Reach's RAM to do more advanced edits to map variants which would otherwise be very tedious or even impossible ingame (using a dll).
The currently loaded forge map is imported into Blender, edited, and then exported back to Reach. After a round restart, changes take effect and can be saved back to the forge map variant.
